The objective of this challenge is determine which dinosaurs are the most imporant of them all. Please read the instructions carefully, as every detail matters.

<b>What You Know</b>
* You will be provided a json file called all-dinos.json
* Each element/item in the json has identical properties
* Each id is unique
* The array 'friends' contains ids of other dinosaurs

<b>Your Objective</b>  
* Parse the json with your language of choice
* A dinosaur is considered the most important by the number of dinosaurs claiming to be their friend (dinos refrencing them in the friend list)
* Once you've determined which dinosaurs are the most important, output the results to a json file
* The structure of the json should just be an array of genus names. Just the values, and no keys.
* (Note to self, if this is too easy, resolve ties by alphabetical order)
